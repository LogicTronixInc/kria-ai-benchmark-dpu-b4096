 While Step 3 is on "Vector Addition- vector_add" Application development which is to validate or verify the custom Platform.


# Ready to use Vitis Platform
In this directory we have provided the ready to use Vitis Platform.
- **kv260_custom-minimal-platform.zip** , after you extract you will get ***kv260_custom*** platform. \
